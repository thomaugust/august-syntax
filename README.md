# August Syntax

A syntax theme based on @simurai's [Duotone Dark Syntax](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-dark-syntax) and @jdsimcoe's [Blessed Dark Syntax](https://github.com/jdsimcoe/blessed-dark-syntax.git).

August is minimal and focuses on highlighting important stuff in cool colours. I based the colour scheme on ![this wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/IhTDfzt.jpg), and I use it in conjunction with One Dark syntax in atom.
